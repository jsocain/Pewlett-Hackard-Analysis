## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are 90,398 employees nearing retirement age. 57,668 of those employees are in senior level roles. There are plenty of employees to mentor the next generation of leaders. Instead of using age to decide who is ready for the mentorship program, we should be looking at job titles and develop junior level roles into senior level roles.

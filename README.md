# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results: 

- There are over 90,000 employees nearing retirement age
- 57,668 of those are Senior staff members
- There are only 1549 employees in the mentorship eligibilty table
- Most definitely will want to open up the mentorship eligibility criteria to a much wider range of employees


## Summary: 

There are 90,398 employees nearing retirement age. 57,668 of those employees are in senior level roles. There are plenty of employees to mentor the next generation of leaders; however, instead of using age to decide who is ready for the mentorship program P-H should be looking at job titles and develop junior level roles into senior level roles.
